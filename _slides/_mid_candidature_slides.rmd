## Motivation

- *Exploratory data analysis (EDA)* is important and ubiquitous
- 2D EDA: visualization is more robust and thorough than statistical summarization alone
- Visualization of high dimension space, $p > 3$ is non-trivial
- We need more options in the analysts' toolbelt

```{r, echo = F, out.width = '80%', out.height = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./slide_figures/AllDinosAnimatedSmaller.gif")
```

Datasaurus dozen; same means, standard deviations, and correlations, *(Matejka & Fitzmaurice, 2017)*

## Visualizing multivariate spaces

Visualization of high dimension space, $p > 3$ is non-trivial:
- Reduce dimension with model or feature production, _parameter space_
- Linear projection of data through an _orthogonal basis_
    - Vectors are at right angles
    - Length of each vector is 1
- Non-linear projection of data
    - _not interoperable_ back to variable space

**Linear projection, shadow analogy:**

```{r, echo = F, out.height = '70%', out.width = '70%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./slide_figures/shadow_puppet.png")
```


---

## Scope of data

```{r, echo = F, out.width = '90%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./slide_figures/tmunzner_vad16.PNG")
```
*(Munzner, 2014)*

__Multivariate tabular__
    
- Can be feature- or parameter- decomposition of non-standard formats


---

## Linear projections

- Simple dimension reduction technique that can highlight interesting features
- Analytical procedures using linear projections:
    - Principal component analysis (PCA)
    - Linear discriminant analysis
    - Multiple regression
- Visual procedures utilizing linear projection:
    - *Tour*, animation of many frames or relatively small changes to the basis
    - Types of tours: grand, guided, little, local, manual (most available in `tourr` R package)
    - *(Cook & Buja, 1997)* provide a method to control the contribution of a single variable in a projection

__This leads to the overarching research objective.__

## Research objectives

__Can geodesic interpolator with user interaction help analysts understand linear projections of data, and explore the sensitivity of structure in the projection to the variables contributing to the projection?__
<br>

- 1) How do we define user interaction for a geodesic interpolator to add and remove variables smoothly from a 2D linear projection of data? 
    - _Algorithm design_ adapt and apply manual interaction (interactive 2D GI)
    
- 2) Do analysts understand the relationship between variables and structure in a 2D linear projection better when the geodesic interpolator is available? 
    - _Experimental study_ comparing the efficacy of 2D GI (2D GI structure study)
    
- 3) Can we define a geodesic interpolator for 3D projections so that the technology can be implemented in modern virtual reality environments? 
    - _Algorithm design_ extend and apply theory to 3D (interactive 3D GI)
    
- 4) Does 3D provide advantages over 2D for understanding structure in high-dimensional data when exploring projections from a geodesic interpolator? (3D GI structure study)
    - _Experimental study_ comparing the efficacy of 3D GI (3D GI structure study)

## Progress since confirmation -- Interactive 2D GI (RO #1)


Paper: 
- R Journal (accepted, to be published in next issue)
- Adaptation:
    - Define the axes of rotation
    - Prove the rotation matrix with the application of Rodrigues' formula *(Rodrigues, 1840)*
    - Include initialization of angles, (in- and out- of projection plane), and clarify for application
- Application to particle physics data
- Appendix A of the milestone document

Software: `spinifex` R package, available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spinifex/index.html)

## Work in progress -- 2D GI usability study (RO #2)

Experimental study:
- Hypothesis: _Does the finer control afforded by the manual tour improve the ability of the analyst to understand the importance of variables contributing to the structure?_
- Factors: principal component analysis, grand tour (grand), and 2D GI
- Within-participant study; all participants will perform all factors
- Implemented via `shiny` application
- Draft of paper included as appendix B of the milestone document

_Designed, ethics approval, currently being piloted_

## Measures and response -- 2D GI usability study

- Logfile capturing every action
- During evaluation:
    - Response, time, number and type of interaction
- Post evaluation survey:
    - Demographics: age, sex, education, English primary language, visualization, and multivariate familiarity
    - By factor, 9-point Likert-type scale: familiarity, ease, confidence, and likability

## Future work -- RO #3

_Interactive 3D GI_

2D GI rotates a 2D basis in a 3D manipulation space about an in-plane angle and an out-of-plane angle.

Analogously, 3D GI rotates a 3D basis in a 4D manipulation space about 2 in-"plane" angles and an out-plane angle.

- Define the 3 axes of rotation
- Solve for the rotation matrix by application of Rodrigues' formula

## Future work -- RO #4

_3D GI usability study_

Option 1: implement using `shinyaframe` and append to the `shiny` application addressing RO #2
- Pro: faster implementation and reuse of previous experimental study application
- Con: unknown extent and extendibility of user interaction
- Proof of concept; _Hadjar et al. (2018)_ user interaction changing axes on a 3D scatterplot 

Option 2: implement in `Unity` and implement a new application for experimental study
- Pro: unimpeded extendibility of user interaction 
- Con: slower implementation and slower and more rework of application

<br><br>
Option 1 seems preferable at the moment
