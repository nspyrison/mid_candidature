## Motivation

- *Exploratory data analysis (EDA)* is important and ubiquitous.
- 2D EDA: vizualization is more robust and thorogh than statistical summarization alone.
- Vizualization of high dimension space, $p > 3$ is non-trivial.
- We need more options in the analysts' toolbelt.

```{r, echo = F, out.width = '80%', out.height = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./slide_figures/AllDinosAnimatedSmaller.gif")
```

<!-- - Visualization is a key aspect of data analysis workflow loop -->

## Visualizing multivariate spaces

Vizualization of high dimension space, $p > 3$ is non-trivial:
- Reduce dimension with model or feature production, _parameter space_
- Linear projection of data through an _orthogonal basis_
    - vectors are at right angles
    - Length of each vector is 1
- Non-linear projection of data
    - _not interoperable_ back to variable space.

**Linear projection, shadow analogy:**

```{r, echo = F, out.height = '70%', out.width = '70%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./slide_figures/shadow_puppet.png")
```

---

## Linear projections

- Classically - identify one or more linear projections highlighting some feature.
- *Tour*,  - animating many frames or relatively small changes to to the basis.
    - Tour path: the changes/path of the basis
    - *(Cook & Buja, 1997)* suggest a method to control the contribution a single variable contributes to the projection.
    
This leads to the overarch research objective.

---

## Scope of data

```{r, echo = F, out.width = '80%', out.height = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./slide_figures/tmunzner_vad16.PNG")
```
*(Munzner, 2014)*

__Multivariate tabular__
    - Can be feature- or parameter- decomposition of non-standard formats.

## Research objectives
<hr><br>

### 1) How can user-controlled steering (UCS) be generalized to work within graphic-specific environments for 2D projections?
### 2) Does 2D UCS tours provide benefits over alternatives?
### 3) How do we extend UCS to 3D?
### 4) Does UCS in 3D displays provide benefits over 2D displays?


---

## RO 2) What benefits does UCS provide over alternatives?

**Future work, method: performance comparison assessed across benchmark datasets**

- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) 
    - A linear transformation that produces linear combinations of the variables in descending order of variation explained
- Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS)
    - Non-linear dimension reduction that compares the pairwise distance between observations
- T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (tSNE)
    - Non-linear transformation preserves local proximity and reduces relative entropy
- User-controlled steering (USC), manual tour
    - Dynamic linear projections controlling the contribution of a selected variable

Measures: variation, variable transparency, clustering, structure

Design space: data sets, techniques, and measures of comparison

---

## RO 3) How do we extend UCS to 3D?

**Future work, method: algorithm design**

Extend the UCS algorithm to 3D projections and integrate with Immersive Analytics Tool Kit, `IATK`, *(Cordeil 2019)* for a common user interface across display devices.

- Extend manipulation spaces to 4D, for variable manipulation on 3D scatterplots 
- multi-dimensional function surfaces

lineup design *(Hofmann et al. 2012)*

- Pick the real data against data generated from the null hypothesis
- Quantitative comparison across display type

## Visualization dimension: 3D and immersive 3D 

Data visualization has lagged behind in adopting 3D and immersive technologies, despite promising finds

.pull-left[
```{r, out.width = '90%', out.height = '90%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./slide_figures/nelson98fig.PNG")
```

*(Nelson et al. 1998)*
- tours: head-tracked VR vs standard monitor
- better cluster and shape identification, slower brushing
]

.pull-right[
3D visuals generally convey more information with more speed, but  manipulation is slower when compared with orthogonal 2D, though 3D with 2D gives the best perception *[Lee 1986, Wickens 1994, Tory 2006]*

Embedded multivariate data in immersive 3D report improved accuracy and faster response time, but a slower manipulation speed and less comfort *[Gracia 2016, Wagner 2018, Nelson 1998]*

Modern VR equipment has improved quality, attracted wider audiences, and reduced the costs of VR, it is timely to research dynamic projections in VR
