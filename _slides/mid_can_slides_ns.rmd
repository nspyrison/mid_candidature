## Motivation

Exploratory data analysis is important and ubiquitous, and it is important to keep visual interpretation: 

![](./slide_figures/AllDinosAnimatedSmaller.gif)

Datasaurus dozen; same means, standard deviations, and correlations, *(Matejka & Fitzmaurice, 2017)*

---

## Context: data analysis workflow

```{r, echo = F, out.width = '80%', out.height = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./slide_figures/data_analysis_workflow.png")
```
*Wickham & Grolemund, 2016*

- Visualization is a key aspect of data analysis workflow loop
- Reproducible from programmatic scripts (& reduced human error)
- Transparent research hosted publicly on [github](https://github.com/nspyrison).

---

## Visualizing multivariate spaces

- Visualization  multivariate space is complex; dimension reduction
- Static projections do not portray all of the variation in the data
- Dynamic rotations do convey more variation and more accurate structure

**Shadow puppet analogy (linear projection from 3- to 2D):**

![Shadow puppet analogy](./slide_figures/shadow_puppet.png)

## Dynamic linear projections, tours   

**Available on CRAN,** `tourr` R package, *(Wickham et al. 2011)*

- Random choice - *grand tour* random forest walk in $p$-space *(Asimov 1985)*
- Data-driven - *guided tour* projection pursuit, optimize an objective function on the projection *(Hurley & Buja 1990)*
- Many other geometric displays, this talk uses scatterplots

.center[grand tour (random):]
```{r, echo = F, out.height = '70%', out.width = '70%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./slide_figures/flea_grand.gif")
```

.center[guided tour - optimizing holes index:]
```{r, echo = F, out.height = '70%', out.width = '70%'}

```

## Visualization dimension: 3D and immersive 3D 

Data visualization has lagged behind in adopting 3D and immersive technologies, despite promising finds

.pull-left[
```{r, out.width = '90%', out.height = '90%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./slide_figures/nelson98fig.PNG")
```

*(Nelson et al. 1998)*
- tours: head-tracked VR vs standard monitor
- better cluster and shape identification, slower brushing
]

.pull-right[
3D visuals generally convey more information with more speed, but  manipulation is slower when compared with orthogonal 2D, though 3D with 2D gives the best perception *[Lee 1986, Wickens 1994, Tory 2006]*

Embedded multivariate data in immersive 3D report improved accuracy and faster response time, but a slower manipulation speed and less comfort *[Gracia 2016, Wagner 2018, Nelson 1998]*

Modern VR equipment has improved quality, attracted wider audiences, and reduced the costs of VR, it is timely to research dynamic projections in VR

## Research objectives
<hr><br>

### 1) How can user-controlled steering (UCS) be generalized to work within graphic-specific environments for 2D projections?
### 2) Does 2D UCS tours provide benefits over alternatives?
### 3) How do we extend UCS to 3D?
### 4) Does UCS in 3D displays provide benefits over 2D displays?


---

## RO 2) What benefits does UCS provide over alternatives?

**Future work, method: performance comparison assessed across benchmark datasets**

- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) 
    - A linear transformation that produces linear combinations of the variables in descending order of variation explained
- Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS)
    - Non-linear dimension reduction that compares the pairwise distance between observations
- T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (tSNE)
    - Non-linear transformation preserves local proximity and reduces relative entropy
- User-controlled steering (USC), manual tour
    - Dynamic linear projections controlling the contribution of a selected variable

Measures: variation, variable transparency, clustering, structure

Design space: data sets, techniques, and measures of comparison

---

## RO 3) How do we extend UCS to 3D?

**Future work, method: algorithm design**

Extend the UCS algorithm to 3D projections and integrate with Immersive Analytics Tool Kit, `IATK`, *(Cordeil 2019)* for a common user interface across display devices.

- Extend manipulation spaces to 4D, for variable manipulation on 3D scatterplots 
- multi-dimensional function surfaces

.pull-left[
```{r, out.width = '70%', out.height = '70%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./slide_figures/f_mt.gif")
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, out.width = '80%', out.height = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./slide_figures/RO3MockUp2.PNG")
```
]

## RO 3) How do we extend UCS to 3D? (& function surfaces)

**Future work, method: algorithm design**

]

.pull-right[
```{r, out.width = '80%', out.height = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./slide_figures/rgl_surface.PNG")
```
]

## RO 4) Does UCS in 3D displays provide benefits over 2D displays?

**Future work, method: usability study**

.pull-left[
lineup design *(Hofmann et al. 2012)*
- Visual variant of statistical p-test
- Pick the real data against data generated from the null hypothesis
- Quantitative comparison across display type

]

.pull-right[
Design space:
- Display type: 2D monitor, 3D monitor, head-mount, physical immersion
- Task type: structure, UCS, clustering, dimensionality
- Measures: accuracy, speed, confidence, preference, demographic information, VR and data visualization experience
