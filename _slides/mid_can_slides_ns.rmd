## Motivation

- *Exploratory data analysis (EDA)* is important and ubiquitous
- 2D EDA: visualization is more robust and thorough than statistical summarization alone
- Visualization of high dimension space, $p > 3$ is non-trivial
- We need more options in the analysts' toolbelt

```{r, echo = F, out.width = '80%', out.height = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./slide_figures/AllDinosAnimatedSmaller.gif")
```

## Visualizing multivariate spaces

Visualization of high dimension space, $p > 3$ is non-trivial:
- Reduce dimension with model or feature production, _parameter space_
- Linear projection of data through an _orthogonal basis_
    - Vectors are at right angles
    - Length of each vector is 1
- Non-linear projection of data
    - _not interoperable_ back to variable space

**Linear projection, shadow analogy:**

```{r, echo = F, out.height = '70%', out.width = '70%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./slide_figures/shadow_puppet.png")
```


---

## Scope of data

```{r, echo = F, out.width = '80%', out.height = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./slide_figures/tmunzner_vad16.PNG")
```
*(Munzner, 2014)*

__Multivariate tabular__
    - Can be feature- or parameter- decomposition of non-standard formats


---

## Linear projections

- Classically identify one or more linear projections highlighting some feature
- *Tour*, animation of many frames or relatively small changes to the basis
    - Tour path: the changes/path of the basis
    - *(Cook & Buja, 1997)* suggest a method to control the contribution a single variable contributes to the projection basis
    
This leads to the overarching research objective

## Research objectives
<br>

__Can geodesic interpolator (GI) with user interaction help analysts understand linear projections of data, and explore the sensitivity of structure in the projection to the variables contributing to the projection?__
<br><br>

#### 1) How do we define user interaction for a geodesic interpolator to add and remove variables smoothly from a 2D linear projection of data? (interactive 2D GI)
#### 2) Do analysts understand the relationship between variables and structure in a 2D linear projection better when the geodesic interpolator is available? (2D GI structure study)
#### 3) Can we define a geodesic interpolator for 3D projections so that the technology can be implemented in modern virtual reality environments? (interactive 3D GI)
#### 4) Does 3D provide advantages over 2D for understanding structure in high-dimensional data when exploring projections from a geodesic interpolator? (3D GI structure study)

## Methodology

Methodology of the research addressing each research objective...

#### RO #1, _algorithim design_ adapt and apply manual interaction (interactive 2D GI)
#### RO #2: _experimental study_ comparing the efficacy of 2D GI (2D GI structure study)
#### RO #3, _algorithim design_ extend and apply theroy to 3D (interactive 3D GI)
#### RO #4: _experimental study_ comparing the efficacy of 3D GI (3D GI structure study)

## Interactive 2D GI (addressing RO #1)

Build on user-controlled manipulation of a selected variable *(Cook & Buja, 1997)*

_progress since confirmation_

Paper: 
- R Journal (accepted, to be published in next issue)
- Adaptation:
    - Define the axes of rotation
    - Prove the rotation matrix with the application of Rodrigues' formula *(Rodrigues, 1840)*
    - Include initialization of angles, (in- and out- of projection plane), and clarify for application
- Application to particle physics data
- Appendix A of the milestone document

Software: `spinifex` R package
- Available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spinifex/index.html)
- Implements of adapted interactive
- Extending the graphics option of `tourr` objects
- Forms the foundation for the remainder of the Research Objectives

## 2D GI structure study (addressing RO #2)

_Designed, currently being piloted_

Experimental study:
- Factors: principal component analysis (PCA), grand tour (grand), and 2D GI
- Within-participant study
- Implemented via `shiny` application
- Draft of paper included as appendix B of the milestone document

<br><br>
Will discuss this in more detail shortly

## ___TODO: EXTEND HERE___--------------------

---

## Interactive 3D GI (addressing RO #3)

_Future work_

2D GI rotates a 2D basis in a 3D manipulation space about an in-plane angle and an out-of-plane angle.

Analogously, 3D GI rotates a 3D basis in a 4D manipulation space about 2 in-plane angles and an out-plane angle.

- Define the 3 axes of rotation
- Solve for the rotation matrix by application of Rodrigues' formula

---

## 3D GI structure study (addressing RO #4)

_Future work_

Option 1: implement using `shinyaframe` and append to the `shiny` application addressing RO #2
- pro: faster implementation and reuse of previous experimental study application
- con: unknown extent and extendability of user interaction

Option 2: implement in `Unity` and implement a new application for experimental study
- pro: unimpeded extendability of user interaction 
- con: slower implementation and slower and more rework of application

<br><br>
Option 1 seem preferable at the moment
