# Rmarkdown note {#sec:intro}

## References and cross references 

A bib reference [@wickham_visualizing_2015]. 

A [Section intro](#sec:intro) reference, alternatively, section \ref{sec:intro} (with no @; \\ref{sec:intro}). 

A figure \@ref(fig:crest) reference (with @; \@ref(fig:crest). 

__For bib files:__ make sure to include `bibliography: <MyFilename>.bib` in the YAML header and have asscociated .bib file in the base directory.

__For Tex Title pages:__ make sure to include them in the YAML header (see this one) and have the asscociated .sty files in the base directory.

__For figure references:__ make sure to use `bookdown::pdf_document2` (with 2) in the yaml, turns an R chunk name into a label, alternatively hardcode labels in the caption with `"\\label{fig:fig1} Some caption here"` while kniting to a `pdf_document`.


## Figure height and width {#sec2:subsection}

`fig.height=2, fig.width=3` [inches] will effect R rendered plots.

while `out.height = "20%", out.width = "20%"` will effect both `include_graphics()` and R rendered plots.


```{r crest, echo=FALSE, out.height = "20%", out.width = "20%", fig.cap = "A caption for crest figure"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/can_con/crest.jpg",)
```

## Intermediate MD formating

sub/superscript^2^~2~

~~strikethrough~~

escaped characters: \* \_ \\

endash: --, emdash: ---

in-line equation: $A = \pi*r^{2}$

equation block: $$E = mc^{2}$$
