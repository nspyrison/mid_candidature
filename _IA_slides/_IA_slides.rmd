## Motivation

- _Exploratory data analysis (EDA)_ is important and ubiquitous
- 2D EDA: visualization is more robust and thorough than statistical summarization alone
- Visualization of high dimension space, $p > 3$ is non-trivial
- _Need more options in the analysts' toolbelt to explore high-dimension spaces!_

```{r, echo = F, out.width = '75%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./slide_figures/AllDinosAnimatedSmaller.gif")
```
Datasaurus dozen; same means, standard deviations, and correlations _(Matejka & Fitzmaurice, 2017)_

---

## Scope of data

__Multivariate tabular,__ $n$ observations of $p$ attributes
- Can be feature- or parameter- decomposition of non-standard formats

```{r, echo = F, out.width = '90%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./slide_figures/tmunzner_vad16.png")
```
_(Munzner, 2014)_

## Linear projections

- Simple dimension reduction, highlight interesting features
- Analytical procedures:
    - Principal component analysis (PCA)
    - Linear discriminant analysis
    - Multiple regression
- Visual procedures:
    - _Tour_, animation of many frames that are close
    - Types: grand, guided, little, local, manual (most available in `tourr` R package)
    - Method to control the contribution of a single variable _(Cook & Buja, 1997)_

__Shadow analogy:__
```{r, echo = F, out.width = '65%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./slide_figures/shadow_puppet.png")
```

---

## Basis

Linear projections are specified by their basis.
- Each column is a linear combinations the original variables 
- _Orthonormal_: all columns at right angles and of length 1

```{r, echo = F, out.width = '82%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./slide_figures/basis.png")
```

---

## Geodesic interpolation (GI)

Selection of intermediate bases along the shortest path of orthonormal bases.

- Used in other tour methods including the grand tour _(Asimov, 1985)_

```{r, echo = F, out.width = '62%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./slide_figures/buja05fig.png")
```
_(Buja et al., 2005)_

---

## Sensitivity of structure in a projection

- Some variables are more sensitive to the structure within a projection
- Illustrated by controling variable contributions:

```{r, echo = F, out.width = '87%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./slide_figures/basisStructure.png")
```

## Work in progress -- 2D GI usability study (RO #2)

.large[.large[ 
Experimental study:
- __Hypothesis:__ _Does the finer control afforded by GI improve the ability of the analyst to understand the importance of variables contributing to the structure?_
- Factors: principal component analysis, grand tour (grand), and 2D GI
- Within-participant study; all participants will perform all factors
- Implemented via `shiny` application
- Draft of paper included as appendix B of the milestone document

## Work in progress -- design

```{r, echo = F, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./slide_figures/experimental_design_personA.png")
```

---

## Work in progress -- introduction & training

```{r, echo = F, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./slide_figures/appTraining1.png")
```

---

## Work in progress -- task training

__Repeated for each factor:__

```{r, echo = F, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./slide_figures/appTraining2.png")
```

---

## Work in progress -- evaluation interface, PCA

```{r, echo = F, out.width = '78%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./slide_figures/appPca.png")
```

---

## Work in progress -- evaluation interface, GI


```{r, echo = F, out.width = '94%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./slide_figures/appManual.png")
```

---

## Work in progress -- evaluation interface, grand

```{r, echo = F, out.width = '86%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./slide_figures/appGrand.png")
```

---

## Work in progress -- follow up survey

```{r, echo = F, out.width = '100%', out.height = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./slide_figures/appSurvey.png")
```

---

## Measures and response -- 2D GI usability study

- Logfile capturing every action
- During evaluation:
    - Response, time, number, and type of interaction

```{r, echo = F, out.width = '75%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./slide_figures/exampleResponse.png")
```

## Future work -- Interactive 3D GI (RO #3)

.large[.large[
2D GI rotates a 2D basis in a 3D manipulation space with 2 angle parameters.

Analogously, 3D GI rotates a 3D basis in a 4D manipulation space with 3 angle parameters.

- Define the 3 axes of rotation
- Solve for the rotation matrix by application of Rodrigues' formula
- Attention to sign changes (4D and trig functions supporting half a rotation)

## Future work -- 3D GI usability study (RO #4)

.large[
Option 1: implement using `shinyaframe` and append to the `shiny` application addressing RO #2
- Pro: faster implementation and reuse of previous implementation
- Con: unknown extent and extendibility of user interaction
- Proof of concept; _Hadjar et al. (2018)_ user interaction changing axes on a 3D scatterplot 

Option 2: implement in `Unity` and implement a new application for experimental study
- Pro: unimpeded extendibility of user interaction 
- Con: slower implementation and slower and rework implementation

## Live example (fingers crossed)

Built off of `spinifex` (on CRAN, new version coming soon!)

Analyst tool:

```
spinifex::run_app("intro")

## Coming soon:
spinifex::run_app("devUnderConstruction")
```

- Run `spinifex_study` app?
