# Introduction {#sec:intro}

## Motivation 
<!-- objectively, why research is important -->

<!-- Visuals are important for EDA -->
The term exploratory data analysis was coined by @tukey_exploratory_1977, who leaves it as an intentionally broad term that encompasses the initial summarization and visualization of a data set. This is a critical first step of checking for realistic values and validating model assumptions. It may be tempting to review a series of summary statistics to check model assumptions. However, there are known datasets where the same summary statistics miss glaringly obvious visual patterns [@anscombe_graphs_1973; @matejka_same_2017]. It is strikingly simple to look at the wrong, or incomplete set of statistics needed to validate assumptions. Data visualization is fast, versatile, and robust relative to the alternative of numeric statistical summarization. Data visualization does and must remain a primary component of data analysis and model validation.

Consider tabular data containing many attributes (variables). Visualization of this ubiquitous type of dataset is key to its understanding and exploration. Visualization of spaces in more than 3 dimensions quickly becomes problematic. We will discuss the use of linear projections to mitigate this obstacle. The motivation for this research is two-fold: expand the dimensionality support and improve the understanding from such visualizations. 

### Current state of the field

<!-- Adding plotting dimensions -->
Consider plotting 2 variables as an XY scatterplot. To add a 3rd variable append the z-axis orthogonal (right angle to) the XY plane. Adding a 4th dimension is not so easily solved. To resolve this we will use scatterplot matrices to introduce axes and bases. Then we generalize to linear projections before discussing principal component analysis and introducing tours.

<!-- explaining axes and bases -->
Scatterplot matrices [@chambers_graphical_1983] plot every combination of variable pairs and views them in a matrix. This is a good method to check variable ranges and extreme values but is not the ideal visualization. Consider a bar stool as in figure \@ref(fig:basisExample). Given 3 still-frames of the variable-pair (that is, a square-on view from each dimension) does not necessarily convey the full information of the data. For instance, a three-quarter perspective helps relate the square on images and are ubiquitous in assembly and machining instructions. This perspective relates information contained in the view of sides. Mathematically, we describe the angle of view as a `basis`. Bases (plural of basis) are depicted as unit axes, they point in the direction each dimension is oriented. The axes for the three-quarter perspective differ from the square-on views in that the directions are a combination of 2 and 3 variables respectively, rather than one variable mapped fully to the horizontal or vertical.

<!-- ```{r basisExample, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "Illustrate the relation between bases, axes, and projection of the data"} -->
<!-- knitr::include_graphics("figures/PLOT_FROM_stool_basis.r.PNG") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- intro into linear projections -->
Building on pairs of variables, an arbitrary `p` variables can be projected down to 2 dimensions. This seems unintuitive at first, but we have already discussed some trivial cases with scatterplot matrices. Consider figure \@ref(fig:basisExample) again. The first 3 cases plot pairs variables, while the third direction extends directly beyond the XY plane. These are trivial projections of 3- down to 2- dimensions, where the 3rd variable has no contribution with a row of zeros in the basis. The three-quarter perspective is more interesting as more than one variable contributes to each direction. The resulting plot is said to be a _linear projection_ when the basis is produced with an affine transformation, that is, any transformation in which all parallel lines remain parallel. One crucial aspect of linear projections is that they are interoperable back to the original attributes; any observation identified in any linear projection can be mapped back to its variable values. Recently, some non-linear projection techniques such as
self-organizing maps [@kohonen_self-organizing_1990] and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding [@maaten_visualizing_2008] have received a substantial following. However, due to their non-linear transformation observations cannot be mapped back to the original attribute-space and interpretation becomes opaque. For this reason, non-linear transformations are precluded from the exploration of data- or parameter-spaces.

<!-- PCA gives one projection -->
Principal component analysis [PCA; @pearson_liii._1901] is one common way of identifying projections to consider. In PCA the new components are formed from a linear combination of the original attributes. The new components must be orthogonal to all previous components and ordered by descending variation explained. A pair of these new components are then viewed as an XY scatterplot. This has the added benefit of viewing the most variation in as few dimensions as possible. The scree plot/test [@cattell_scree_1966] can be used on the components to quickly zero in on a space that has the intrinsic dimensionality of the data. This is a common data processing step once the number of attributes becomes sizable (larger than 10 or so).

<!-- LDA + PDA? basis -->
<!-- Full sample variation is not the only interesting feature. Clustering, that is group data into discrete values is common. A related task is to identify the basis whos projection distinguishes the clusters most.  Linear discriminant analysis [@fisher_use_1936]... Penalized discriminant analysis [@hastie_penalized_1995]...
<!-- for PDA_pp see [@lee_projection_2010], projection pursuit index for large n, small p. -->

## From discrete to continuous

<!-- Grand Tour -->
The above methods have suggested a _discrete_ number of linear projections to look at. At the same time, the stool example illustrates that looking at intermediate views improves understanding. A _continuous_ animation of the object being rotated would improve this understanding even further. This is analogous to the idea of a data visualization _tour_[@asimov_grand_1985; @buja_grand_1986]. A tour produces a relatively high number of linear projections and views them in quick succession, typically as an animation. When the bases have a relatively small change in the contributions the projections are much closer. Single points and features can be tracked and follow from projection to projection allowing for a better understanding of the local structure. 

<!-- Tour paths  -->
One key feature of tours is the selection of the path animated.
Asimov originally purposed a _grand_ tour. In the grand tour, several target planes are identified somewhat close to the starting basis. Many interim planes are found between target planes via geodesic interpolation. Figure \@ref(fig:grandFrames) illustrates a simplification of this process. A _little_ tour [@wickham_tourr:_2011] starts on a basis with only 2 variables contributing and trades the contribution one variable for another single variable. This effectively animates between the planes displayed in a scatterplot matrix. A _local_ tour explores a dense area of the possible projections around the initiated basis. It walks a short distance away before returning to the starting basis and selecting a new random frame very nearby.

```{r grandFrames, echo=FALSE, out.width = "80%", fig.cap = "Simlified illustration of a grand tour target and interim frames  (Buja et al. 2005)"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/buja05fig.PNG")
```

<!-- PP and guided tour -->
The _guided_ tour [@cook_projection_1993] makes use of projection pursuit [@kruskal_toward_1969; @kruskal_linear_1972] to identify a path. Here a selected index function is selected. Starting from the initial basis several nearby bases are checked to see if they perform better on the index function. If so, this new basis is moved and nearby bases are checked again in an iterative process. If the closest bases do not perform better, bases slightly further away are checked as in simulated annealing [@kirkpatrick_optimization_1983]. If no better basis is identified within the selected stopping criterium, the algorithm stops.

<!-- knowledge gap -->
The discrete methods above identity bases that highlight some feature. The above tours can help understand the structure leading to and from certain projections. To explore higher dimensional spaces visually, we need _human-in-the-loop_ [@karwowski_international_2006] tools. We need to be able to choose and direct the change to a basis. [@cook_manual_1997] introduces the idea of the _manual_ tour. In a manual tour, an individual variable is selected as the manipulation variable. Its contribution to the basis is then controlled. The contributions of the remaining variables also change as they perform an orthogonally-constrained rotation. Figure \@ref(fig:manipSpace) This allows for the exploration of a given projection as defined by the user. 

```{r manipSpace, echo=FALSE, out.width = "50%", fig.cap = "Manipulation space of a manual tour. Variable 5 is being manipulated as though the red segment is rotated about the origin changing the contribution of all variables on the basis axes on the blue projection plane."}

## Research objectives
<!-- NS: Need to edit for mid can yet: -->

Data and models are typically high-dimensional, with many variables and parameters. Developing new methods to visualize high dimensions has been a pursuit of statisticians, computer scientists and visualization researchers for decades. As technology evolves examining, extending, and assessing current techniques, in new environments, for new data challenges, is an important endeavor. The primary objectives of this Ph.D. research can then be summarized as the following.

1. **How can UCS be generalized to work within graphic-specific environments for 2D projections?**\
Building from the UCS algorithm in @cook_manual_1997, the algorithm should be modified for generalized use with graphic-specific environments. This enables fine control to explore the sensitivity of structure to the variable contributing to the projection and sets the foundation to be used in the remaining objectives.

2. **Does 2D UCS tours provide benefits over alternatives?**\
The quality and effectiveness of 2D UCS will be compared with alternatives of static, single, linear and non-linear projection techniques. They will be quantified by the measurement of structure, variation, and clustering across on benchmark datasets.

3. **How can UCS be extended to 3D?**\
The addition of a 3rd dimension potentially allows for the improved perception of the structure of the data in dynamic UCS. To investigate this UCS algorithm needs to be extended to a third dimension. This would also allow for novel application multi-parameter function projection. This will involve the addition of a new angle and it controls the projection space, reference axes, and manipulation space. In particular, the manipulation space, now in 4D, will be hard to visualize, but it should be able to stand as a mathematical construct facilitated through interaction with a point (the projection coefficients of the selected manipulation variable) on the now 3D reference axes volume. 

## Methodology
<!-- NS: Need to edit for mid can yet: -->

This research is interdisciplinary; touring was developed by statisticians to explore physics data. Modern advances in hardware from information technology allow for 3D rending in higher quality and immersion than previously possible. Looping back to the original use care, applications in high energy physics identified [@cook_dynamical_2018].

The research corresponding with RO #1 entails _algorithm design_ following and further clarifying the work done in @cook_manual_1997. In the application of the manual tour, we clarified the creation of the rotation matrix. The key to the matrix is to specify the 2 axes of rotation for the manipulation space and apply Rodegeze's formula. In the application, attention was given to both pre-compiled tour and human-in-the-loop UCS. We provide an open-source version of the manual tour in the R package, `spinifex`, which has since been published on CRAN. This forms the foundation for future work in the remaining objectives.

The second objective is addressed with a benchmark dataset _performance comparison_ between dynamic linear projections and alternatives (static linear and static non-linear projections such as principal component analysis, multidimensional scaling, and t-distributed neighbor embeddings, described in more detail in chapter \ref{ch:future_work}). Benchmark datasets will be compared across techniques, measurements will include variation explained, transparency to the original variable space, clustering identification, and outlier identification.

The research resulting from RO #2 is a controlled _experimental study_ to explore the efficacy of interactive UCS compared with the benchmarks factors of PCA and the grand tour.
This is designed as a within-participant study where each participant performs all factors. the study is balanced by assigning participants into one of 3 groups where the factor order is controlled by a Latin square while simulation order remains the same.
<!-- Within each factor, 2 tasks are performed. Each factor-task is performed on increasing difficulty of simulations is a block in the study. Quantitative measurements include participant speed and accuracy of tasks and subjective Likert surveys of participants. A lineup-type model as outlined in @hofmann_graphical_2012 may also be employed for assessing the quality of display types. -->

The research for RO #3 involves **algorithm design**, where the work in RO #1 will be extended to display with the use of a third spatial dimension. This will also be used to develop visualizations of projected multi-dimension function surfaces. This forms the calculation base for the work. Several difficulties may arise when bringing dynamic projection into 3D spaces, especially when exploring 3D surfaces (discussed in more detail in chapter \ref{ch:future_work}).


# Progress since confirmation

During the candidature confirmation review (27 March 2019) we discussed exploratory data analysis, visualization of high dimensional spaces, covered the literature for tours and 3D rendering for information perception. We concluded with a process for a manual tour that allows for user-controlled steering. The appending the document was a mostly complete R package and respective paper providing an open-source application as well as clarifying the rotation matrix that was outlined in @cook_manual_1997.

## Publication

The paper has since been accepted in the R Journal and it currently undergoing editorial review. This will be published in the first issue of 2020 and available at [journal.r-project.org](https://journal.r-project.org/).

## Software

The R package, `spinifex (v0.1.0)`, has been approved and hosted for public use on the Comprehensive R Archival Network, CRAN (cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spinifex/)(https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spinifex/index.html).

New functionality has been added to the development branch, specifically around the interactive use. A user application is developed with `shiny`[@chang_shiny:_2018]. It allows users to explore their data without the need for coding familiarity. It features interactive or precompiled manual touring. It also contains a gallery for flagging bases which can then further be reviewed or saved as .gif and .png files.

## Experimental study

<!-- Design completed, pilot testing underway, experiment to be rolled out in the coming weeks. -->
<!-- [include in supplementary material] -->

The prominent appeal of the manual tour is that it allows users to control the contributions of individual variables. In theory, this should enable the finer exploration of features of interest. The hypothesis we will study is _Does the finer control afforded_ _by the manual tour improve the ability of the analyst to understand the_
_importance of variables contributing to the structure?_
